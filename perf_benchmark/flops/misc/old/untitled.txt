Workers (This happens no matter what when requesting a lot of workers (400+):
Timesout at 30s, when it does timeout, seems like Abaco freaks out and a worker stays in submitted sometimes, other times it stops and whatever amount of messages were sent out are done. For example, asked for 550, one time, a worker stayed in requested, other time 329 workers went to ready.
Seems to get around 300-350 workers up whenever it does timeout.

Deleting actors:
If there's too many workers it'll time out after 30s and whatever workers are left won't be deleted. Starting at 500 workers, 73 were left after timeout. So timesout around when there is 350+ workers.

Sometimes when messaging:
{\n  "message": "Unrecognized exception type: <class \'RuntimeError\'>. Exception: Timeout waiting for opening the socket", \n  "result": null, \n  "status": "error", \n  "version": ":dev"\n}\n
Looks like RabbitPy is also timing out, can't find anywhere that Abaco configures it, default it times out at 3s.
